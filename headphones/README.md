# 🎧 Headphones Website Project

This project is part of the **ALX HTML & CSS Curriculum**, designed to teach web development fundamentals through hands-on projects. The goal of this project is to replicate a beautifully designed headphones landing page using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques.

## 📁 Project Structure

This project includes the following:

- **HTML** markup that is clean, accessible, and semantically structured.
- **CSS** using advanced selectors, flexbox, responsive layouts, and hover/active states.
- **Responsive Design** that adapts to both desktop and mobile views.
- **Assets** such as images, fonts, and icons linked or imported as per the Figma design.

## 🎨 Figma Design

To follow along with the original design:

1. Create a [Figma account](https://figma.com) (if you haven’t already).
2. Open the [Headphones Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/xxxxx/Headphones) _(Replace with actual link)_.
3. Click **"Duplicate to your Drafts"** to get full access to measurements, fonts, colors, and layout specifications.

### Fonts

If you're missing the fonts used in the design:

- [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.dafont.com/spin-cycle-ot.font) _(or similar)_

> Some Figma values may be floats — feel free to round as needed.

## 📱 Responsive Features

- ✅ The site switches to **mobile view** when screen width is `480px` or less.
- ✅ Max content width is `1000px` and centered on the page.
- ✅ All **links** use hover/active color: `#FF6565`.
- ✅ **Buttons** have `opacity: 0.9` on hover/active.
